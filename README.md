This study investigates the prediction of tennis match outcomes using various statistical and machine learning methods, 
with a focus on the Elo rating system and its variations, the Bookmaker Consensus Model, and the Glicko system. The primary
objective is to accurately forecast the winner or loser of a tennis
match, using available match statistics data. The performance
of each prediction method is evaluated and compared, examining
the trade-offs between model complexity, efficiency, and usability.
The results offer an understanding of how each method performs
in predicting match outcomes and highlight the relative strengths
and limitations of each approach.
